    <h1>Module 4: Normal Newborn</h1>
    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Describe physiologic challenges of newborn transition</li>
      <li>Perform comprehensive newborn assessments</li>
      <li>Educate families on safety and routine screenings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4.1 Transition to Extrauterine Life</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Initiation of breathing triggered by chemical, thermal and tactile stimuli.</li>
      <li>Fetal shunts (ductus venosus, foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus) close after birth.</li>
      <li>Newborns rely on brown fat for thermoregulation and are prone to heat loss.</li>
      <li>Glucose and bilirubin metabolism reflect immature hepatic function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4.2 Initial Assessment and APGAR Scoring</h2>
    <p>APGAR evaluates heart rate, respiration, tone, reflex and color at 1 and 5 minutes.</p>

    <h2>4.3 Physical Assessment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Inspect head, neck, chest, abdomen, genitourinary system and extremities.</li>
      <li>Note normal variations such as molding, milia and Mongolian spots.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4.4 Neurological Assessment and Reflexes</h2>
    <p>Primitive reflexes—including Moro, rooting, sucking and Babinski—indicate neurologic integrity.</p>

    <h2>4.5 Gestational Age Assessment</h2>
    <p>The Ballard score evaluates physical and neuromuscular maturity to estimate gestational age.</p>

    <h2>4.6 Routine Newborn Care</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Administer eye prophylaxis and vitamin K.</li>
      <li>Initiate feeding and monitor for jaundice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4.7 Infant Safety and Identification</h2>
    <p>Use ID bands, safe sleep practices and car seat safety education.</p>

    <h2>4.8 Newborn Screening Programs</h2>
    <p>Metabolic screening, hearing tests and critical congenital heart disease screening are performed prior to discharge.</p>

    <h2>4.9 Common Variations and Concerns</h2>
    <p>Educate parents about benign conditions like acrocyanosis and erythema toxicum as well as warning signs requiring care.</p>

    <h2>4.10 Discharge Planning and Parent Education</h2>
    <p>Ensure physiologic stability, caregiver readiness and follow-up appointments before discharge.</p>
