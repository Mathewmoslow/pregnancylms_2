    <h1>Module 2: Normal Labor and Birth</h1>
    <h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognize signs of impending labor and differentiate true vs false labor</li>
      <li>Analyze factors affecting the labor process</li>
      <li>Describe stages of labor and maternal/fetal responses</li>
      <li>Understand pain mechanisms, comfort measures and FHR interventions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.1 Premonitory Signs and Labor Onset</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Lightening, Braxton Hicks contractions, cervical changes and energy burst may precede labor.</li>
      <li>True labor features regular contractions with cervical change; false labor lacks progressive change.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.2 The Five Ps of Labor</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Passenger:</strong> fetal head, presentation, position, lie.</li>
      <li><strong>Passageway:</strong> maternal pelvis and soft tissues.</li>
      <li><strong>Powers:</strong> uterine contractions and maternal pushing.</li>
      <li><strong>Position:</strong> maternal positioning; upright positions often enhance progress.</li>
      <li><strong>Psyche:</strong> psychological response influenced by support and culture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.3 Cardinal Movements</h2>
    <p>Engagement, descent, flexion, internal rotation, extension, external rotation and expulsion allow fetal navigation through the pelvis.</p>

    <h2>2.4 Stages of Labor</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>First stage:</strong> latent, active and transition phases culminating in full dilation.</li>
      <li><strong>Second stage:</strong> pushing and birth of the fetus.</li>
      <li><strong>Third stage:</strong> delivery of the placenta.</li>
      <li><strong>Fourth stage:</strong> immediate postpartum recovery.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.5 Pain in Labor</h2>
    <p>Pain arises from uterine contractions and perineal stretching. Perception is influenced by physiologic, psychological and environmental factors.</p>

    <h2>2.6 Comfort Measures and Pain Relief</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Non-pharmacologic: breathing, relaxation, movement, hydrotherapy, heat/cold, massage, acupressure.</li>
      <li>Pharmacologic: systemic opioids, epidural, spinal and local anesthesia.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2.7 Maternal and Fetal Assessment</h2>
    <p>Monitoring includes vital signs, contraction pattern, cervical change, fetal heart rate and Leopold's maneuvers.</p>

    <h2>2.8 Nursing Care During Labor</h2>
    <p>Includes admission assessment, ongoing support, documentation and participation in delivery and postpartum stabilization.</p>

    <h2>2.9 Fetal Heart Rate Interpretation</h2>
    <p>FHR patterns are categorized as Category I (normal), II (indeterminate) or III (abnormal). Interventions include position changes, oxygen, fluids and adjusting oxytocin.</p>

    <h2>2.10 Labor Support and Environment</h2>
    <p>Continuous labor support improves outcomes and satisfaction. Creating a respectful, culturally sensitive environment supports physiologic birth.</p>
