    <h2>1.1 Historical and Current Trends</h2>
    <h3>Historical Context</h3>
    <p><strong>Traditional Birth Practices (Pre-1900s)</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Home births attended by midwives or relatives</li>
      <li>High maternal and infant mortality with limited intervention</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Medicalization of Birth (1900-1950)</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shift to hospital births and physician attendance</li>
      <li>Obstetric anesthesia introduced; mortality decreased but interventions increased</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Modern Era</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Evidence-based practice and technology such as ultrasound</li>
      <li>Family-centered care and focus on patient autonomy</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Current Trends</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Hospital births remain most common but interest in alternative settings growing</li>
      <li>Technological advances like NIPT and telemedicine</li>
      <li>Cultural shifts including delayed childbearing and diverse family structures</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.2 Family-Centered and Evidence-Based Care</h2>
    <p>Core components include respect for family values, information sharing and collaboration. Evidence-based practice integrates research, clinical expertise and patient values.</p>

    <h2>1.3 Healthy People 2030 Goals</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduce maternal and infant mortality</li>
      <li>Increase early prenatal care and breastfeeding rates</li>
      <li>Address social determinants such as education and economic stability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>1.4 Maternal/Fetal Morbidity & Mortality</h2>
    <p>Maternal mortality in the U.S. is 23.8 deaths per 100,000 live births with significant racial disparities. Infant mortality is 5.8 per 1,000 live births; leading causes include congenital malformations and preterm complications.</p>

    <h2>1.5 Community-Based and Post-Birth Services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Home visiting programs such as Nurse-Family Partnership</li>
      <li>Community health centers providing prenatal and pediatric care</li>
      <li>Lactation support, postpartum doulas and well-child services</li>
