Chapter 26: Family Planning

Contraceptive methods, effectiveness, and patient counseling strategies.

Key Points:
- Categories: Permanent, LARC, hormonal, barrier, natural methods, emergency contraception
- LARC options: IUDs and implants offer highest effectiveness with minimal user error
- Combined oral contraceptives: Prevent ovulation, risk of VTE, daily compliance needed
- Barrier methods: Condoms provide dual protection (pregnancy + STIs)
- Emergency contraception: Most effective within 72 hours, not for routine use
- Counseling considerations: Safety, STI protection, lifestyle, cost, beliefs, age
- Natural family planning: Requires training, high failure rate with typical use
- Nursing role: Education, empowerment, partner inclusion when appropriate
