Chapter 21: Assessment of the Normal Newborn

Systematic assessment techniques for evaluating newborn health and development.

Key Points:
- Initial assessment focuses on ABCs, thermoregulation, and identifying anomalies
- Normal vital signs: RR 30-60, HR 120-160 (awake), 80-100 (sleep), Temp 97.7-99.5Â°F
- Ballard Score combines neuromuscular and physical maturity to estimate gestational age
- Head assessment: Check for molding, fontanels, cephalohematoma vs caput
- Neurologic reflexes: Moro, rooting, sucking, grasp, Babinski
- Monitor for jaundice progression (cephalocaudal), hypoglycemia signs
- Normal measurements: Weight 2500-4000g, Length 48-53cm, Head 32-38cm
- Behavioral states: Quiet alert optimal for interaction
