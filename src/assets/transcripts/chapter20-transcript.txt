Chapter 20: Normal Newborn - Processes of Adaptation

Understanding how newborns transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life.

Key Points:
- Three fetal shunts close after birth: Ductus venosus, Foramen ovale, Ductus arteriosus
- Respiratory adaptation: Surfactant prevents alveolar collapse, first breath triggered by chemical, mechanical, thermal, and sensory stimuli
- Thermoregulation: Newborns lose heat through evaporation, conduction, convection, and radiation. Brown fat provides non-shivering thermogenesis
- Hepatic adaptation: Glucose regulation begins, bilirubin processing starts
- Normal glucose: 45-50 mg/dL before feeding
- Periods of reactivity: First reactivity (0-30 min), Sleep phase (60-120 min), Second reactivity
- Immune system: IgG from placenta, IgA from breast milk, IgM synthesized by infant
